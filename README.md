# Template-Matching
Python Code

# In Real time template matching first you have to capture a frame
  so that you can select the roi (region of interset) by croping
  the image from photos or any app.(In simple words, the Thing which
  you want to match in real time.
  After then run the code again and comment those lines which are capturing
  the first frame.
  You will see the matching in real time and if the matching object is not matched 
  then it will make an alarm.
  
  
  Thank you........!
